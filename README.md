# 🧪 Real-Time Monitoring of Cleanroom Conditions – MSD Animal Health

## 📌 Objective
This project monitors and visualizes key environmental conditions in pharmaceutical cleanrooms to ensure GMP compliance and environmental control in sterile manufacturing areas.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Power BI
- Excel (for data collection and transformation)
- Cleanroom sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure, CFU)

## 📊 Monitored Metrics
- **CFU/m³** – Colony Forming Units per cubic metre (air contamination)
- **Temperature (°C)**
- **Humidity (%)**
- **Differential Pressure (Pa)**

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- **Time Series Chart**: Tracks the trend of key environmental variables over time
- **KPI Cards**: Current real-time values for CFU, temperature, and humidity
- **Data Table with Conditional Formatting**: Highlights out-of-spec values for quick identification
- **Interactive Date Filter**: Allows users to focus on specific time ranges
- **Scatter Chart**: Visual correlation between CFU levels and temperature readings

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Detected spikes in **CFU levels** on specific dates (e.g., 20/05/2025), which could indicate air contamination or procedural failure.
- **Differential pressure drop** (9.5 Pa) on 14/05/2025 flagged a potential air pressure imbalance.
- Environmental trends are stable over time but require proactive monitoring for anomalies.

## 🧑‍⚕️ Business Relevance
This dashboard is used in pharmaceutical manufacturing to:
- Maintain **environmental compliance** (EU GMP Annex 1)
- Quickly identify cleanroom deviations
- Support batch release decision-making

> **Note**: All data is anonymised/simulated for training and educational purposes.
